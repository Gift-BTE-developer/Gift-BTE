2 #number of boundaries

#boundary indexs #boundary condition:1:thermalization #temperature//31:leftandright,32:topandbottm//periodic: give -index-1 for example, if "0" boundary is connected to 3 boundary set second term as "-4", detT and 0, means you want set the temperature differece as detT for periodic bound; 0 and 0 means no temperature difference, do not set other value if you do not need temperature difference
